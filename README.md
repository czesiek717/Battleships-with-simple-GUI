# Battleships-with-simple-GUI
It's one of my first projects.

This battleships game bases on JButtons instead of any custom graphics and fields. This game was more of a algorithm practice then graphics presentation.
Game lacks "new game" option, basically it has to be turned off and on again to play a new game. This is an unfinished project. 
Only game type vs AI works proberly. Other game types have been disabled through code, although some progress into making this game 1v1 on 
same machine can be found inside. Ready to run .jar game file can be found in out\artifacts\Battleships_jar.
